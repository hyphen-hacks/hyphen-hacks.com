Thank you for your interest in volunteering for Hyphen-Hacks! We have three ways
you can help out:

- Mentors are available during the hackathon to provide help for our attendees.
- Judges look at all submitted projects and determine which ones receive awards.
- Volunteers help us out with various tasks during the hackathon. These could
  include setting out food, signing attendees in and out, and providing
  assistance to people hosting workshops.

Mentor and judge applications are open! Click the button below and select
"Mentor/Judge" to start your application.

Volunteer applications will open in Fall 2019 (the exact date will be posted
here once it has been determined). Check back here to find the application once
it is open.

You can also sign up for our mailing list to be notified when they are
available.
