Thank you for your interest in volunteering for Hyphen-Hacks! We have three ways
you can help out:

- Mentors are available during the hackathon to provide help for our attendees.
- Judges look at all submitted projects and determine which ones receive awards.
- Volunteers help us out with various tasks during the hackathon. These could
  include setting out food, signing attendees in and out, and providing
  assistance to people hosting workshops.

We will open applications for mentors and judges on <time datetime="2019-05-13">
May 13, 2019</time>. Volunteer applications will open at a later date in Fall
2019 (the exact date will be posted here once it has been determined). Check
back here to find the applications once they are open.

You can also sign up for our mailing list to be notified when they are
available.
