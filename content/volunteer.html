                    Thank you for your interest in volunteering for
                    Hyphen-Hacks! We have three ways you can help out:
                </p>
                <div class="content">
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            Mentors are available during the hackathon to
                            provide help for our attendees.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Judges look at all submitted projects and determine
                            which ones receive awards.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Volunteers help us out with various tasks during the
                            hackathon. These could include setting out food,
                            signing attendees in and out, and providing
                            assistance to people hosting workshops.
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                </div>
