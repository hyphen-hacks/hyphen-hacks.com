## What is a hackathon?

A hackathon is an event that usually lasts for 24 hours but can go for as long
as 3 days. During this confined period, engineers, computer scientists, and
designers work together to build a project from scratch, often with very little
sleep. The goal of a hackathon is not to build a polished product, but to hack
something together and in the process make mistakes and learn new ways of
solving problems. A hackathon does not have anything to do with 'hacking' in the
sense of defeating the security of computers.

## Who can participate?

Anyone who is enrolled in a high school between the 9th and 12th grades may
participate in Hyphen-Hacks.

## Can you sleep?

Yes, you can sleep at the campus. We recommend you bring a sleeping bag.

## Do I need to stay the entire time for the hackathon?

No. However, we will close doors for part of the night. We do recommend that you
stay the whole time so that you can gain the most experience possible.

## Does it cost money to participate?

Participation in Hyphen-Hacks is completely free, as the event is funded by our
sponsors.

## Will there be supervision?

Yes, there will be a teacher from LWHS on site and many parent volunteers
supervising the kids.
